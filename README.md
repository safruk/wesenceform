#Wesence Form Challenge

Form Challenge Given by Wesence Technology

Form design achieved
Responsiveness achieved
Form validation achieved

Things I learned:
How to build custom radio buttons using html/css
How to use css grids to style a form
VSCode has become buggy.Problem with HTML/CSS support extension encountered.Uninstall the extension and reinstall to fix this issue.

Things to fix:
minor changes to the grid layout
add icons preferably svg
Make the design pixel perfect

Possible Future enhancements:
Use custom error messages for validation
